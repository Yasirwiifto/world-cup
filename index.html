     <h2>The waiting is over!</h2>
     <p> After over four years of waiting, another FIFA World Cup is finally here.
        The 2022 Fifa World Cup tournament will take place in Qatar with many of the world's best players 
        vying for the biggest football trophy of them all as the group stage begins at the end of this week.
    </p>

    <p>
       The first team I will be supporting is going to be Argentina because of Lionel Messi.
        Messi is a 35 years old, and is set to play in his final FIFA World Cup as the 2022 edition takes place in Qatar, 
        with Argentina slated as a potential winner.
        The all-time great has won just about everything there is to win at the elite level of world football,
        except for the one crowning achievement â€” a FIFA World Cup.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Argentine superstar will be 39 years old by the time the 2026 World Cup in the United States comes around, 
        and only a handful of players have participated in a major international tournament at that advanced age.
        Back in March 2022, Messi said he was only focused on the immediate future, and his long-term plans were not yet known.
        But he hinted at the decision that he eventually announced.

        Argentina are considered one of the challengers for the 2022 World Cup title, but they're not among the top betting candidates. 
        That designation falls to the likes of Brazil, France, and England.
        Still, Messi's side has drawn a group they're capable of winning, 
        with fellow Group C teams Mexico, Poland, and Saudi Arabia all considered beatable by the No.
         3 team in the world. Should Argentina advance to the knockout stage, their quarterfinal opponent would come from Group D,
        which includes France, Australia, Denmark, or Tunisia. That makes it vital for Argentina to win Group C, 
        giving them the best chance to avoid expected Group D winners France, who knocked them out of the 2018 World Cup in the quarterfinals.
        A potential win in the quarterfinals would see Argentina match up with an opponent 
        from either Group A or B, which could include the likes of England, the Netherlands, Senegal, Wales, or the United States.
