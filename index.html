     <h2>The waiting is over!</h2>
     <p> After over four years of waiting, another FIFA World Cup is finally here.
        The 2022 Fifa World Cup tournament will take place in Qatar with many of the world's best players 
        vying for the biggest football trophy of them all as the group stage begins at the end of this week.

    <p>
       The first team I will be supporting is going to be Argentina because of Lionel Messi.
        Messi is a 35 years old, and is set to play in his final FIFA World Cup as the 2022 edition takes place in Qatar, 
        with Argentina slated as a potential winner.
        The all-time great has won just about everything there is to win at the elite level of world football,
        except for the one crowning achievement â€” a FIFA World Cup.

    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Argentina</li>
