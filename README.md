# Purpose of the project
Your first project is to create a Hobby Page. This can be about one of your hobbies, a particular interest of yours, or a public figure you admire. You are not required to make this about yourself or disclose anything personal. The page will be built with HTML, styled with CSS and use a bit of JavaScript.

# Requirements
<li>The page has a title which informs the user what the site is about.</li>
<li>The page has a logical layout and clear structure.</li>
<li>There are images on the page, with alt-text where appropriate.</li>
<li>The page is visually interesting, for example with borders or colours.</li>
<li>A list is visible somewhere on the page.</li>
<li>Everything on the page fits on any screen size, without content overflowing or being cut off.</li>
<li>A user can click on a link that takes them to another website.</li>
<li>The page has a header element, and a footer element.</li>
<li>Somewhere on the page, the user can see today’s date. </li>
<li>The date should always be correct. </li>
<li>You’ll need to use JavaScript to generate the date, and DOM manipulation to display it.</li>
